# Semantic Segmentation Task with UNet Architecture
I developed a convolutional neural network that can be used to label each pixel of the images to 1 of 9 provided classes (the boundary class is excluded). This was a final project of an AI course at my university. With 1000 original pairs of image and label, the final model with basic UNet architecture achieved 64.86% mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) on the test set.
